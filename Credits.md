# Credits

The majority of icons were originally created by [Bamboolord](https://github.com/RealBamboolord).<br>
The Hacking site improvement and its tile art were borrowed from the "DeCiv 1" iteration of DeCiv.<br>
The Life Research Site improvement data was originally created by [EPG](https://github.com/EPG333), and the tile sprite was borrowed from [Indonesian Gentleman](https://github.com/carriontrooper) with his permission.<br>
Unmanned Combat Vehicle and Swarm Drones (icons and sprites; modified in the case of the former unit's sprite) were also borrowed from Indonesian Gentleman with his permission.<br>
Medical Support Drone and its icon and sprite were originally created by EPG and borrowed with his permission.<br>
All other icons that have been added after Bamboolord temporarily discontinued work on The Mechanized are from The Noun Project, licensed under Creative Commons or Public Domain (which has the unfortunate side effect of clashing with the custom images from the original mod maker).
